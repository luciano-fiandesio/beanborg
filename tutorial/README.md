# Beanborg tutorial

This tutorial guides the user through the steps required to import financial transactions from a fictional bank (Eagle Bank) into an existing Beancount ledger, using [Beanborg](https://github.com/luciano-fiandesio/beanborg).

## Initial setup

The tutorial is based on an existing Beancount setup, structred like [so](https://github.com/luciano-fiandesio/beanborg/tree/master/tutorial):

```
accounts.ldg
main.ldg
  |
  |__ UK0000001444555.ldg
```

To get started, install beanborg using `pip`:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/luciano-fiandesio/beanborg.git
```

To get an idea of the Beanborg workflow and learn about the different configuration options, you might want to take a quick look at the project's [README](https://github.com/luciano-fiandesio/beanborg/blob/master/README.md).

The goal of this tutorial is to be able to import the transactions from the [sample CSV](https://github.com/luciano-fiandesio/beanborg/blob/master/tutorial/test-data/eagle-bank-statement.csv) file into the ledger-managed `UK0000001444555.ldg` file.

## Creating a configuration file for Eagle bank

Beanborg requires a configuration file for each type of CSV file that we wish to import. 
Normally, each CSV file is bound to a financial institution, so it's good practice to name our config file after the bank. In this case, `eagle.yaml`.

Let's create a new folder where we will store the import configuraton.

```
mkdir config
```

Create a new `eagle.yaml` file in the `config` folder.

Now, let's open the fictional CSV file, located in the `test-data` folder. It is important to understand the structure of the CSV file in order to configure Beanborg properly.

```
OPEN BOOK;VALUE DATE;TX TYPE;BOOKING TEXT;AMOUNT;CURRENCY;ACCOUNT;IBAN
04.11.2020;04.11.2020;Direct Debit;"Fresh Food";-21,30;EUR;0000001;UK0000001444555
04.11.2020;03.11.2020;Credit;"Best Company";1000,00;EUR;0000001;UK0000001444555
01.11.2020;01.11.2020;Direct Debit;"Doctor Bill";-540,10;EUR;0000001;UK0000001444555
01.12.2020;01.11.2020;Cash Withdrawal;Bank Of Mars;-100;EUR;0000001;UK0000001444555
```

By observing the CSV file, we can determine the following information:

- we want to skip the first line
- the field delimiter uses the `;` character rather than the more standard comma
- the currency separator uses the `,` character rather than the more standard `.`
- the date format uses day, month and year, separated by a dot.
- in order to match the ledger file `UK0000001444555.ldg` to this account we can use the `IBAN` field of the CSV file

Let's start creating the configuration file for Eagle Bank. Paste the following snippet in the previously created file,`eagle.yaml`:


```
--- !Config
csv:
   download_path: !CHANGE ME!
   name: eagle
   bank_ref: eag
   separator: ';'
   date_format: "%d.%m.%Y"
   currency_sep: ","
```

During a normal import operation, the CSV file is downloaded from the bank app - mobile or web and placed in a download folder. For the sake of the tutorial, you can copy the file `eagle-bank-statement.csv` to your Downloads folder and replace `!CHANGE ME` with the path to the folder, e.g. `/Users/tom/Downloads`.

Let's look at this initial configuration.
The `name` property is required to find the CSV file in the path specified by the `download_path` property. It is enough to specify the first letters of the CSV file, without the `csv` extension.

The `bank_ref` property is very important, because it is used by Beanborg to rename the CSV file and move it to the staging area. If one has multiple bank accounts to import, it is crucial that the value of `bank_ref` is unique.

The `date_format`, `separator` and `currency_sep` should be self-explanatory.

We don't need to specify the `skip` property, since the default value is `1`.

Let's try to import the CVS file into the working area, using `bb_mover`.

```
bb_mover -f config/eagle.yaml
```

If the file is found, the script should return:

```
Done :)
```

## Add the mapping information and rules to the configuration file

In order to successfully import the transaction from Eagle Bank into our ledger, we need to supply some more information to Beanborg: CSV mapping info and rules.

Append the following configuration to the `eagle.yaml` file:

```
indexes:
    date: 1
    tx_type: 2
    counterparty: 3 
    amount: 4
    currency: 5
    account: 7
```

Note that the `indexes` block sits at the root of the yaml file (same "level" as `csv`)


With this block of configuration we are instructing Beanborg about the data within our CSV file.
This image should hopefully makes the concept more clear:

![Alt text](assets/csv.png)

Beanborg is now able to map the most relevant information of the CSV file with the Beancount structure and create a valid transaction.

The last section of the configuration relates to **rules**. 

Rules can be considered as a list of "actions" that are executed one after the other and are applied to each row of the CSV file we want to import.

There are different type of rules: some can be used to change the Accounts of a transaction or ignore a specific transaction.

Let's focus on a simple rule, that will assign the correct Expense to each transaction in our CSV file. 


Append the following configuration to the `eagle.yaml` file:

```
rules:
  ruleset:
    - name: ReplaceExpense
```

Before importing the CSV data, we need one last step: a configuration file (named `asset.rules`)  that helps Beanborg associate the bank account asset definition (`Assets:Bank1:Bob:Current`, which is the bank account defined in Beanborg used in this tutorial) to the bank account identifier in the CSV file (in this tutorial, the IBAN number).
Note that this file is required by the `ReplaceAsset` rule, which is automatically executed, even if it's not specified in the rules list.

In Beanborg, all configuration files are placed into the `rules` folder - note that the folder name can be changed using the `rules_folder` property of the `rules` configuration.

```
mkdir rules
cd rules
touch asset.rules
```

Copy the following content into `asset.rules`

```
value;expression;result
UK0000001444555;equals;Assets:Bank1:Bob:Current
```


It's now time to run the second Beanborg script, `bb_import`, which imports the transaction into the ledger.

```
bb_import -f config/eagle.yaml
```

The script should exit immediately with the following error:

```
file: rules/account.rules does not exist! - The 'ReplaceExpense' rules requires the account.rules file.
```

The `ReplaceExpense` rules requires an additional look-up table file to map counterparty names to Expense categories.
This file (named `account.rules`) should be located in the `rules` folder.


Create a new `account.rules` file in the `rules` folder and paste the following data:

```
value;expression;result
Fresh Food;contains;Expenses:Groceries
Best Company;contains;Expenses:Clothing
Doctor Bill;eq;Expenses:Medical
```

Run `bb_import -f config/eagle.yaml` again and, this time, the import should be successful.

```
summary:

csv tx count:         4
imported:             4
tx already present:   0
ignored by rule:      0
error:                0
```

Each row in the CSV file is matched against the `account.rules` file, and if the `counterparty` index matches the first part of the expression (e.g. `Fresh Food`), the second leg of the transaction is replaced with the propert Expenses category, in this case `Expenses:Groceries`.

The `UK0000001444555.ldg` should now contain the 4 transactions from the CVS file and both "sides" of the transaction should be correctly set - except for one transaction: the cash withdrawal from bank of Mars. We will see how to correctly categorize this transaction as well.

Running the same script again `bb_import -f config/eagle.yaml` will trigger the automatic duplication detection mechanism:

```
summary:

csv tx count:         4
imported:             0
tx already present:   4
ignored by rule:      0
error:                0
```

Note that the value of `tx already present` is `4` and `imported` is set to `0`.

At this time, Beanborg does not support executing the rules without importing the data. In order to show how to import the cash withdrawal entry from our sample bank file, we need to delete and recreate the sample ledger file:

```
rm UK0000001444555.ldg
touch UK0000001444555.ldg
```

Let's take a look at the cash withdrawal entry from the CVS file:

```
01.12.2020;01.11.2020;Cash Withdrawal;Bank Of Mars;-100;EUR;0000001;UK0000001444555
```

We want to create a transaction that has the origin account set to our bank and the destination account set to `Assets:Cash:Bob`
We can create a new rule in the `account.rules` file:

```
Bank Of Mars;contains;Assets:Cash:Bob
```

but this is probably not such a good idea, because we may have multiple type of transactions from `Bank of Mars`, for instance bank fees.
Since the CSV entry clearly specifies `Cash Withdrawal` as transaction type, we can simply add a new `SetAccounts` rule that makes use of the transaction type to assign the accounts to the transaction; add the following rule definition to the `eagle.yaml`:

```
- name: SetAccounts
      from: Assets:Bank1:Bob:Current
      to: Assets:Cash:Bob
      csv_index: 2
      csv_values: Cash Withdrawal
```

Let's re-run the import script `bb_import -f config/eagle.yaml`: this time all four transactions should be properly categorized.
The `SetAccounts` rules uses the `csv_index` to determine which index of the csv to analyze (remember, the indexes count starts from `0`) and the `csv_values` determines the string that should match the value of the index. If a match is found, both `from` and `to` accounts are set on the transaction.

## Archive the CSV bank file

Once the CSV file is imported, we need to archive the CSV file. Note that this step is mandatory. If one do not need to archive the CSV file, it is important to clean the "staging" folder of the working file: `rm tmp/*.*`, assuming the default value of the `csv.target` property is used.

The archiving script simply moves the CSV file from the stage directory (`tmp`) to an `archive` directory. Additionally, it renames the CSV file by appending to the name the first and last date of the transaction.
Let's take as an example the CSV file from Eagle bank. When the file is imported into the staging area, it gets renamed to `eag.csv`.
The archive script analyzes the CSV file and extracts the first and last transaction, so that the file is renamed to `eag_2020-11-01_2020-11-04` and moved to the `archive` folder.
Let's try:

```
bb_archive -f config/eagle.yaml
```

The output should look like:

```
✓ detecting start and end date of transaction file...
✓ moving file to archive...
✓ removing temp folder
```

Note that the `bb_archive` has also removed the stage folder `tmp`.
